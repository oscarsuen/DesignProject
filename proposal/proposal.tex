\section{Goals}
The goal of the project is to create a Java application that simulates 2D Cellular Automata according to certain rules.  2D Cellular Automata are played on a board with cells that can either be alive or dead, or on or off.  These cells switch on and off according to certain rules about how many live cells there are next to it.  The most famous example of this is Conway's Game of Life.
